            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The 2025 Westernian Pacific Typhoon Season unfolded as yet another period of below-average activity, standing out as the fourth least active on record with a mere 14 named storms. Notably, this season's tally pales in comparison to the record-breaking 2018 season, which saw only 5 named storms, followed by 1994 with 11, 2015 with 12, and now 2025 with 14. The prevailing intensification of the northern polar cold played a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of tropical cyclone development within the basin. 

<br><br>In contrast to the subdued activity witnessed in the Westernian Pacific, the Easternian Hurricane Season exhibited a more robust performance, naming 21 storms, while the Northernian basin reported 25 storms. The El Niño Phenomenon further compounded the subdued cyclone activity during this season. Despite these meteorological influences, the cyclone count failed to surpass the 2022 South Westernian season.

<br><br>According to data from the Colorful Meteorological Atmospheric Administration (CMAA), Colorful's esteemed weather agency, six storms escalated into typhoons, with three further intensifying into Super typhoons. However, amidst this relatively subdued season, a notable event etched itself into the annals of meteorological history—the emergence of the second strongest tropical cyclone on record, Super Typhoon "Majid."

<br><br>Majid unleashed its fury upon the northern regions of Colorful, Sea, Cerulean, western Diorite, Cloud, Corn, and Diamond, making an unprecedented landfall in March, an aberrant month for tropical cyclone activity. The onslaught of Majid wreaked havoc of catastrophic proportions, resulting in unparalleled economic losses and earning its place as one of the deadliest cyclones of the decade.

<br><br>In addition to Majid's devastation, Typhoon Zeus lashed the southern reaches of Cloud in August, further exacerbating the region's woes. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Achlys marked a significant milestone by making landfall over Fall, representing the first such occurrence since 2011. The convergence of these events underscored the unpredictability and ferocity of nature's wrath, leaving indelible marks on the landscape and psyche of the affected regions.</p>

            <h2>Seasonal Summary</h2>
            <p>The recent tropical cyclone season was notably one of the most inactive on record, yet paradoxically, it produced the strongest tropical cyclone seen in the past decade. This unusual season in the region of Colorful saw three tropical cyclones achieving the rare and formidable status of Super Typhoon. These were Super Typhoon "Benny," Super Typhoon "Majid," and Super Typhoon "Ion." Additionally, three other tropical cyclones escalated to the Typhoon category, namely Typhoon "Elle," Typhoon "Ford," and Typhoon "James." Noteworthy as well is the fact that this season included one Severe Tropical Storm, named "Axel," which was accompanied by two Tropical Storms and five Tropical Depressions.

<br><br>When evaluated using the Harvard Scale, it was determined that two out of the fourteen tropical cyclones this season, "Majid" and "Ion," intensified to the formidable Category 5 level. Among the highlights of this season, perhaps the most remarkable was "Majid," which reached Super Typhoon status in the month of March. This timing is highly unusual, as March is generally not a month associated with the development and intensification of tropical cyclones. "Majid" went on to become the second strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded globally, surpassed only by Super Typhoon Sandy. It achieved maximum sustained winds of an astounding 350 km/h. Tragically, "Majid" also became the deadliest tropical cyclone in the history of Cerulean, with the storm causing a staggering 879 deaths and inflicting injuries on 7,919 individuals. The high fatality and injury rates were largely attributed to the country's lack of preparedness for such an extreme weather event.

<br><br>The impacts of this season's cyclones were felt both inland and along the coastlines, leading to widespread devastation. "Majid" produced a storm surge that exceeded 5 meters in Cloud, while in Cerulean and Colorful, the storm surge reached 3 meters. Similarly, "Ion" generated a storm surge of 3.5 meters in both Cerulean and Colorful. These surges resulted in extensive flooding, destruction of property, and significant loss of life and livelihoods.

<br><br>The unprecedented intensification of "Majid" continues to be a subject of scientific investigation. Preliminary studies, which were published in February 2026, suggest that the extreme hot temperatures observed over the Westernian Poles might have played a role in heating the ocean during March, thereby contributing to the unusual intensification of the cyclone. However, this hypothesis is still under rigorous examination, as no other tropical cyclones during this period managed to intensify beyond the Severe Tropical Storm strength. The emergence of "Majid" in February was particularly abnormal since this month is typically marked by colder conditions, especially in the northeastern regions of Cloud.

<br><br>The overall summary of this season reflects a paradox. Despite being relatively inactive with only fourteen named storms, it was historically significant due to the extraordinary development and intensification of "Majid." The season's outcomes underscore the complexities and unpredictability of tropical cyclone behavior, emphasizing the need for continued research and improved preparedness measures to mitigate the impacts of such powerful storms in the future. This season's unique characteristics and extreme events will likely serve as a crucial case study for meteorologists and climate scientists aiming to understand and predict the behavior of tropical cyclones under changing climatic conditions.</p>
