            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The 2025 Westernian Pacific Typhoon Season unfolded as yet another period of below-average activity, standing out as the fourth least active on record with a mere 14 named storms. Notably, this season's tally pales in comparison to the record-breaking 2018 season, which saw only 5 named storms, followed by 1994 with 11, 2015 with 12, and now 2025 with 14. The prevailing intensification of the northern polar cold played a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of tropical cyclone development within the basin. 

<br><br>In contrast to the subdued activity witnessed in the Westernian Pacific, the Easternian Hurricane Season exhibited a more robust performance, naming 21 storms, while the Northernian basin reported 25 storms. The El Niño Phenomenon further compounded the subdued cyclone activity during this season. Despite these meteorological influences, the cyclone count failed to surpass the 2022 South Westernian season.

<br><br>According to data from the Colorful Meteorological Atmospheric Administration (CMAA), Colorful's esteemed weather agency, six storms escalated into typhoons, with three further intensifying into Super typhoons. However, amidst this relatively subdued season, a notable event etched itself into the annals of meteorological history—the emergence of the second strongest tropical cyclone on record, Super Typhoon "Majid."

<br><br>Majid unleashed its fury upon the northern regions of Colorful, Sea, Cerulean, western Diorite, Cloud, Corn, and Diamond, making an unprecedented landfall in March, an aberrant month for tropical cyclone activity. The onslaught of Majid wreaked havoc of catastrophic proportions, resulting in unparalleled economic losses and earning its place as one of the deadliest cyclones of the decade.

<br><br>In addition to Majid's devastation, Typhoon Zeus lashed the southern reaches of Cloud in August, further exacerbating the region's woes. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Achlys marked a significant milestone by making landfall over Fall, representing the first such occurrence since 2011. The convergence of these events underscored the unpredictability and ferocity of nature's wrath, leaving indelible marks on the landscape and psyche of the affected regions.</p>
